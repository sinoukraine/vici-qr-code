                                <p>Travel notes can record your current driving distance, driving time, and driving track (need to be supported by GPS power cable, like Q2). Before parking, keep your mobile and the car DVR in connection, then you can synchronize the GPS datum to your mobile, just by refreshing mobile APP.</p>

If the vehicle has been parked indoor for a very long time, the positioning can be completed within 3 minutes after the car has been driven to some open field.</p>

                                <p>The mobile is connected to the DVR by point-to-point private connection. It creatively adopts Wi-Direct technology, with which the communication speed is 60 times faster than that of through blue tooth. It does not pass through 3G/4G networks, so it would not consume any 3G/4G flux. No need uploading, to protect your privacy. After connection to APP, you can directly preview or download videos. You don’t have to take memory card or dismantle the DVR. Suggest to connect and use it within 10 meters range</p>
