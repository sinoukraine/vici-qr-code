                                <p>The max induction distance for hand-gesture shooting can be up to 10CM. You can define the induction distance within the range. Methods: put your palm to certain shooting distance which you think is good, then get the power through the DVR. When you hear song, then the set-up is done. The induction is only available within the set distance.</p>

                                <p>Can smart car DVR support parking monitor?The reason why the DVR stops recording is that since the DVR power source is connected to the cigar lighter of vehicle. So the power will be cut off and cigar lighter will be off when the car stopped . At the same time, the car DVR stops recording without power supply.To realize parking surveillance we can adapt following 3 methods A. Connect to non-stop power section of vehicle. So long as the car DVR is connected to electronic circuits where the power is still on after the vehicle stops engine (shut down power key), through a down-pressure cable for parking monitor, such as central control platform circuit and alarmcircuit. Therefore when the car stops(turn off the power key) will not effect the car DVR so that we can achieve the parking monitor.PS: We suggest that the car owner take off the power plug if the car would not be driven for more than one week, so as to avoid car start-up problem because of the low battery. B. Connect to fuse box. When the car DVR is connected to fuse box, when the vehicle is impacted, the car parking monitor will be started up so as to achieve 24H parking monitor C. Connect to portable power bank. Connect the portable power bank to car DVR to achieve parking monitor. You can select one from above based on actual conditions so as to protect your dear car around the clock.</p>
